## Description
 Due to current work situations, I am required to now make appointments with clientele. I was originally struggling with keeping track of whom I had made appointments with, Also, I wanted something more interesting than google calander. What better than to make my own appointment tracker? Electron-Scheduler is an application you can use to set appointments and see those which you've completed. It is still in development and there will be more features to come!

## Installation
 This application will soon be built and packaged. Until then you can run these commands to use this software:
 ~git clone https://github.com/KantKontrol/Electron-Scheduler.git 
 ~cd Electron-Scheduler
 ~npm install && npm run dev
